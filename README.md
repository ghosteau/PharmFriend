This is purely a concept right now being fed random training data and evaluated based upon that.

In an ideal world, we can this decision tree real metrics and evaluate how it performs. On the current concept data, it is performing exceptionally well, which leads me to believe a decision tree or random forest will be the best route for this concept.

Thank you for checking it out, much love.

This is purely a concept right now being fed random training from Kaggle and evaluated based upon that. It is a very basic decision tree algorithm, however, I think with more developers and software engineering, this could have use in a real-world setting if implemented accordingly.

This is one of my older concepts, so this one is probably going to be on the back burner for a while, especially because real medical data is sensitive and hard to find. I would also be open to trying out neural networks rather than a decision tree algorithm.

UPDATE: I decided to do it in Python and R just to give a basic idea of what it could look like!
